## Introduction 🎯
This project provides Python code snippets demonstrating how each of the basic operators works. Operators are symbols that perform specific operations on variables and values. By understanding how different operators behave, you can write more efficient and concise Python code.

## Operators Overview 🔧

### Arithmetic Operators ➕ ➖ ✖️ ➗
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

```python
a = 10
b = 5

# Examples:
print(a + b)  # Addition
print(a - b)  # Subtraction
print(a * b)  # Multiplication
print(a / b)  # Division
print(a % b)  # Modulus
```

### Assignment Operators ✏️
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables, with some operators combining arithmetic operations with assignment.

```python
x = 10
x += 5  # Add and assign
x -= 3  # Subtract and assign
x *= 2  # Multiply and assign
x /= 4  # Divide and assign
```

### Comparison Operators 🔍
Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a Boolean result.

```python
a = 10
b = 5

# Examples:
print(a == b)  # Equal to
print(a != b)  # Not equal to
print(a > b)   # Greater than
```

### Logical Operators 🤔
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements (Boolean expressions). They return a Boolean result based on the logic applied.

```python
x = True
y = False

# Examples:
print(x and y)  # Logical AND
print(x or y)   # Logical OR
print(not x)    # Logical NOT
```

### Identity Operators 🔑
Identity operators are used to check whether two objects refer to the same memory location.

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
z = x

# Examples:
print(x is y)    # Check if x and y refer to the same object
print(x is z)    # Check if x and z refer to the same object
```

### Membership Operators 🔎
Membership operators are used to test whether a value is a member of a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string).

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Examples:
print(3 in list1)  # Check if 3 is in list1
print(6 not in list1)  # Check if 6 is not in list1
```

### Bitwise Operators 💻
Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on integers, such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and bit shifts.

```python
a = 60  # Binary: 0011 1100
b = 13  # Binary: 0000 1101

# Examples:
print(a & b)  # Bitwise AND
print(a | b)  # Bitwise OR
print(a ^ b)  # Bitwise XOR
```
